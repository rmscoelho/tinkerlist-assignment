## Starting the project

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a
development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

## Things to improve

- Currently, the calculations are done through looping the data, this could be done in a more efficient way (someone talked about flat maps, but I still need to explore that way of doing it);
- I would need to learn more about Tailwind CSS, and its best practices, as currently I'm using it for the first time;
- In the future, I wouldn't use a table to display the data, as it is harder to make it responsive. I would use flexbox instead, and change the way the data is displayed on smaller screens;
- I would find an alternative to the FontAwesome icons, or at least the way they are used in the project, as it is limiting in the way I can manipulate them after render;
- Visually, I would also improve the animations, and add some, where necessary;
- I need to learn more about Svelte 5, as it is rather new, and had some big changes compared to Svelte 4;
- I feel like my code could be better, and for that I need to focus on improving my JavaScript and TypeScript skills;
- I was a bit confused about the calculations for the back time, I wouldn't mind if someone could explain it to me;

## Final thoughts

While I am satisfied with the project, I would like to improve it, and it made me think about my skills and knowledge, and what I should focus on to improve my skills.

Whatever you decide about making me an offer, or not, I would love to get some feedback about my work, and the ways I could improve it, as it would be a great way to learn and grow, and to understand different (maybe better) ways of doing things.

Thank you for reading, and I hope you enjoyed the project!
